.SYNOPSIS
  Checks that robot traffic will actually reach the robot, before you rely on it.

.DESCRIPTION
  Run this FIRST in the shop, once both NICs are up. It exists because of one specific failure
  mode: with a VPN NIC and a robot NIC in the same laptop, robot traffic can silently leave via
  the wrong interface. The Driver Station then shows no robot, or worse, shows an intermittent
  one, and nothing in the routing table looks obviously wrong.

  Windows picks a route by longest prefix match first, then by metric. That usually saves you:
  the robot NIC gets a connected /24 for 10.17.45.0, which beats a VPN's 0.0.0.0/0 or even a
  10.0.0.0/8 that a corporate VPN advertises.

  What it does NOT save you from is a VPN client that enforces full tunnelling at the driver
  level — Zscaler, GlobalProtect and some AnyConnect profiles have a kill-switch mode that drops
  non-tunnel traffic regardless of routes. The routing table looks perfect and the packets die
  anyway. That is why this script pings rather than only reading routes: the check has to be
  empirical.

Section "If robot traffic is on the wrong interface"
Write-Host @"
  Two fixes, in order of preference.

  1. Add a specific route for the robot subnet, pinned to the robot NIC. Longest prefix match
     means a /24 beats anything the VPN advertises short of the same /24:

       # find the robot NIC's ifIndex from the table above, then, as Administrator:
       New-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix 10.17.45.0/24 -InterfaceIndex <ifIndex> -RouteMetric 1

     Remove it afterwards with Remove-NetRoute -DestinationPrefix 10.17.45.0/24.

  2. Lower the robot NIC's interface metric so it wins ties:

       Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex <ifIndex> -InterfaceMetric 1

  If routes look correct and pings still fail, the VPN client is enforcing full tunnelling
  below the routing layer. No route will fix that — disconnect the VPN while testing. That is
  the case this script cannot work around, only identify.
